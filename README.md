# github-basics-sFritz
This is a repository used to the instructions in my class. 

### Questions
*1.*
Git is the client side version control manager, where you commit and pull and clone, for various tasks, 
Github is like the central server that stores repositories

*2.*
The repository is where you store your code
You have branches which are just copies of the main code made to keep the main code safe while editing
You have forks, which are copies of someone elses code, that you basically took and now edit
And you have clones, which are just copies of the repository that people can aquire 

*3.*
Cloning creates a whole new local repository, while as forking makes a fork of the original that is also on github
Use cloning if yout going to edit it for just you or use it
Fork if its for public use, or if you'll merge later

*4.*
To make changes in github, its rather simple and streamlined as if you use branches, you gain the ability to work on the code without damaging the main code or altering it, later merging it to the main file system

*5.*
The purpose of the pull request is to merge the branch with the main codebase. Its used to combine branches to places that are locked, to insure that all code is compatiable 

*6.*
Issues benefit the project through the spreading of knowledge of errors and bugs. It also acts as a forum for suggestions. 

*7.*
The importance of commit messages are that they show and describe what each commit did to the codebase. Making it easier to track where errors came from. More importantly _who_ they came from. Good commit messages are simple, to the point, and descriptive. 

*8.*
The benefit of using branches is that each person can copy their own version of the code to their mini-repo's, that way they can edit their code, preparing to update the main vesion but while its broken, not break the entire program.

*9.*
A readme file is where you go on a git repo, to read what the program does, and how to use it. 
A good readme includes the following
- Purpose
- Instruction to use
- Instruction to intsall

*10.*
You can _optimize_ someones elses unoptimized code. Allowing you to practice with different, more interesting codebases. 
You can post your finished projects or code, like your arch dotfiles which are very useful to newer users 
You can post your unfinished projects and get random strangers to help you, making the process.. maybe faster..?
