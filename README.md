This is a repository used to the instructions in my class. 

### Questions
*1.*
Git is the client side version control manager, where you commit and pull and clone, for various tasks, 
Github is like the central server that stores repositories

*2.*
The repository is where you store your code
You have branches which are just copies of the main code made to keep the main code safe while editing
You have forks, which are copies of someone elses code, that you basically took and now edit
And you have clones, which are just copies of the repository that people can aquire 

*3.*
Cloning creates a whole new local repository, while as forking makes a fork of the original that is also on github
Use cloning if yout going to edit it for just you or use it
Fork if its for public use, or if you'll merge later

*4.*
